# AI RaceTrack Evolution    
[*To Simulation*](https://azp3001.github.io/main/)

A 2D Race-Track simulation where AIs learn to navigate a racetrack through evolution algorithms.

## Overview
The simulation puts a population of cars onto a track. Each car is controlled by a neural network wich processes "lidar" data to produce continuous control outputs. Only the best performers pass their "genes" (weights) to the next generation.

### The Learning Process
The AIs have four primary control axes. To allow for more precise controls the axes are **analog (0-100%)**, allowing for more precise & smooth driving:
* **Gas**
* **Brake**
* **Steer Left**
* **Steer Right**

## Configuration & Settings
Fine-tune the simulation and the learning process using the built-in settings.

### AI & Evolutionary Parameters
* **Pop Size:** The number of agents generated per generation.
* **Elite Clones:** Number of top-performing agents preserved exactly for the next generation (prevents regression).
* **Mutation Rate:** The probability and intensity of random changes to the neural weights.
* **Hidden Layers:** Adjust the complexity of the AI's "brain" by changing the number of internal neurons.
* **Initial TTL (Time-To-Live):** A countdown timer for each agent. Agents must reach checkpoints to reset this timer, ensuring they don't just sit still.
* **Target Laps:** Defines the goalpost for a successful generation before moving to the next stage of evolution.

### Physics Engine
* **Max Speed:** Maximum Speed of the Cars.
* **Acceleration:** Acceleration to the Max Speed.
* **Turn Speed:** Controls how quickly the cars are able to turn.
* **Grip:** Doesnt do much, introduced as a fix for turning Physics.

### Simulation Control
* **Simulation Speed:** Adjust the simulation speed.
* **Hyper Mode:** Simulates as fast as your PC allows. (Doesn't render for even faster Processing)

## Spectator Mode
Click any car on the track to pin the telemetry panel and sensor overlay to it — it stays highlighted until it crashes or you click empty space / hit "Release". With nothing selected, the panel auto-follows whichever car currently has the best fitness.

## Track Editor
Besides placing points by hand, the editor now has three ways to build a track:
* **Draw:** switch to the Draw tab and drag a loop directly on the canvas — it's simplified into an editable path automatically.
* **Import from Image:** upload a PNG/JPG (a hand-drawn loop or a photo of a track layout) and it's analyzed (thresholded, skeletonized, traced) into a starting track for you to refine.
* **Duplicate:** clone the currently-selected track as a starting point for a variant.

Tracks you create are saved in your browser (localStorage) and are still there next time you load the page, alongside your last-used sim/physics settings.

### Publishing a track for everyone
Hit **Publish** while editing a track to open a prefilled GitHub issue with the track's data. A GitHub Actions workflow validates the submission and opens a pull request adding it to `tracks.js` — once a maintainer merges it, it's live for everyone. No account/backend setup needed beyond GitHub itself.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
* **Space:** Play / Pause
* **H:** Toggle Hyper Mode
* **R:** Reset
* **Esc:** Cancel track editing, or release a manual spectator selection

## Performance
Neural network weights are stored as flat `Float32Array`s (not arrays-of-arrays), which makes copying/mutating brains and shipping a generation to the Web Worker pool considerably cheaper — the biggest lever on how many generations per second you get out of Hyper Mode.
